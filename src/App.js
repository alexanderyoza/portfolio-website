        I am currently 
        a student at the University of California San Diego. 
        I am motivated by my desire to learn and improve as 
        I believe there is too much information in this world for 
        someone ever stop exploring. I am pursing a degree in 
        Computer Science and I am captivated by the puzzle-like tasks 
        that come with my classes. During my free time, I enjoy playing beach
        volleyball, surfing and playing video games.
