            I am currently 
            a student at the University of California San Diego. 
            I am motivated by my desire to learn and improve as 
            I believe there is too much information in this world for 
            someone to ever stop exploring. I am pursing a degree in 
            Computer Science and I am captivated by the puzzle-like tasks 
            that come with my classes. During my free time, I enjoy playing beach
            volleyball, surfing and playing video games.
